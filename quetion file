9.Write a program that print the current balance of the account, ask the user to enter the withdrawal amount.

if withdrawal amount is less than current balance,
    deduct the withdrawal amount form the current balance, if current balance after deduction is less than 500 INR, deduct penalty of 50 INR and print current balance and penalty.
    otherwise, print the current balance.
If withdrawal amount is greater than current balance, print insufficient funds.
Sample run 1
Current balance = 5000
Enter withdrawal amount - 4600
Current balance = 350
Penalty = 50

Sample run 2

Current balance = 500

Current balance = 5000
Enter withdrawal amount - 5600
insufficient funds

While Loop Practice
1.Write a program to print all the digits of a given number.

Sample 
input - 1234
output - 
4
3 
2
1
Explanation
- get remainder of input to get last digit - input % 10 will give 4 as remainder
- now last was extracted, discard the last digit from the input - input = input / 10 will dicard the last digit 4
- repeat the process till input become zero.

digit = input % 10;
input = input / 10;
print the digit

2.Write a program to print sum of all the digits of the given number. Accept number as input from user.

Sample run
input - 12345;
output - 15

Explanation
   - get digits from number one by one - digit = input % 10;
   - add digit to sum one by one - sum = sum + digit;
   - now discard the last digit - input = input / 10;
   - repeat the process till input become zero  
sum = 0;
iteration 1
input = 12345;
digit = input % 10; // 12345 % 10 -> 5 
sum = sum + digit; // 0 + 5 -> 5
input = input / 10; // 12345 / 10 -> 1234 

iteration 2
input = 1234; // now the input become, 1234, due to first iteration
digit = input % 10; // 1234 % 10 -> 4 
sum = sum + digit; // 5 + 4 -> 9
input = input / 10; // 1234 / 10 -> 123 

iteration 3
input = 123; // now the input become, 123, due to last iteration
digit = input % 10; // 123 % 10 -> 3 
sum = sum + digit; // 9 + 3 -> 12
input = input / 10; // 123 / 10 -> 12

iteration 4
input = 12; // now the input become, 12, due to last iteration
digit = input % 10; // 12 % 10 -> 2 
sum = sum + digit; // 12 + 2 -> 14
input = input / 10; // 12 / 10 -> 1

iteration 5
input = 1; // now the input become, 1, due to last iteration
digit = input % 10; // 1 % 10 -> 1 
sum = sum + digit; // 14 + 1 -> 15
input = input / 10; // 1 / 10 -> 0

 
3.Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number N and print the sum. Accept the number N from user.

4.Implement a program that computes the factorial of a given number N using a loop and print the factorial. Accept the number N from user.

   Sample
   N = 5
   output = 120
   Explaination
   5 factorial => 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 => 120
5.Write a program that checks if a given number N is prime if yes print number N is prime number otherwise print number N is not a prime number. Accept the number N from user.

6.Write a program to print the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Accept the number N from user. Constrain N >= 0 and N <= 20. (keep value of N small. )

Sample 
N = 10
output = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,34
Explanation
first trem is 0 (known)
second trem is 1 (known)
third term = 0 + 1 = 1
fourth term = 1 + 1 = 2
so on.... next term is sum of last two terms


What is Fibonacci Series?

The Fibonacci series is the sequence of numbers (also called Fibonacci numbers),
where every number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, such that the first two terms are '0' and '1'.
In some older versions of the series, the term '0' might be omitted. 

A Fibonacci series can thus be given as, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . 
It can thus be observed that every term can be calculated by adding the two terms before it.

Given the first term, F0 and second term, F1 as '0' and '1' respectively,
the third term here can be given as, 
F0 = 0, F1 = 1,
F2 = F0 + F1
F2 = 0 + 1 = 1

Similarly,

F3 = 1 + 1 = 2
F4 = 2 + 1 = 3
F5 = 2 + 3 = 5
F6 = 3 + 5 = 8
F7 = 5 + 8 = 13
and so on

7.Write a program to print the sum of first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Accept the number N from user. Constrain N >= 0 and N <= 20. (keep value of N small. )

N = 8
output = 33
Explaination 
 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 fibbonacci series for N = 8

sum = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 


8.Write a program to check if a given three-digit number N is an Armstrong number if yes, print Armstrong number otherwise print Not an Armstrong number. Accept the three-digit number N from user.
Sample 
Input N = 371
output = Armstrong number
Explanation :

An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.

33 + 73 + 13

27 + 343 + 1 => 371

9.Generate the multiplication table for a given number N up to 10. Accept the number N from user.

10.Write a program to calculate numberpower (number raised to the power) using a loop. Accept the number and power from user.

Sample

number = 2, power = 5

output = 32

Explanation

25 = 32

9.Write a program to print all the numbers divisible by 5, from 1 to 100.
Sample output
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 
10.Write a program which accepts the starting point and end point from the user and print the sum of all the values between the starting point and end point. Starting point is inclusive and end point is exclusive.
Sample run
enter the starting point - 10
enter the end point - 15
sum = 60

Explaination:
sum all the values between 10 to 15, as starting point is inclusive 
10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14
15 is not considered for sum as loop must iterate < 15
so the result is 60

Hint:
- i should be initialized with stating point 
- i should be less than end point
11.Write a program which accepts the starting point and end point from the user and print the sum and count of all the even values between the starting point and end point. Starting point and end point both are inclusive.
Sample run
enter the starting point - 10
enter the end point - 20
sum = 90
count = 6


Explaination:
sum all the even values between 10 to 20, as starting point and end point both are inclusive 
10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20
so the result is 90, and count is 6
